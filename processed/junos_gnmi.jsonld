Please refer to the Juniper Site for details on configuration using Certificates.\n\nThis was tested on the vMX 22.3R1.11 and vQFX 19.4R1.10 Note: Although configuration is accepted on the vQFX it was not possible to get GNMI working on this platform. This could be due to the fact that the insecure mode is not supported in earlier releases",
