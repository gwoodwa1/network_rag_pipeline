# Security Guidelines

This document outlines security best practices and implementation guidelines for our system.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Token Security

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for stateless authentication:

- Tokens expire after 1 hour for security
- Refresh tokens are valid for 30 days
- Use strong, random secrets for token signing
- Implement token blacklisting for logout

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const generateToken = (user) => {
  return jwt.sign(
    { id: user.id, email: user.email },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: '1h' }
  );
};
```

### Password Security

Password handling requirements:
- Minimum 8 characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols
- Hash passwords using bcrypt with salt rounds â‰¥ 12
- Implement password history to prevent reuse
- Enforce password rotation every 90 days

## Input Validation

### SQL Injection Prevention

Always use parameterized queries or ORMs:

```sql
-- Bad: Direct string concatenation
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '" + userInput + "'

-- Good: Parameterized query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?
```

### XSS Prevention

Sanitize all user inputs:
- Escape HTML entities in output
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Validate input on both client and server side

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest

Sensitive data must be encrypted using AES-256:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

def encrypt_sensitive_data(data, key):
    cipher = Fernet(key)
    encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(data.encode())
    return encrypted_data
```

### Encryption in Transit

All communications must use TLS 1.2 or higher:
- HTTPS for web traffic
- TLS for database connections
- mTLS for service-to-service communication

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Event Logging

Log all security-relevant events:
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization failures
- Data access patterns
- Admin actions

### Incident Response

Incident response procedures:
1. Immediate containment
2. Impact assessment
3. Evidence collection
4. System recovery
5. Post-incident review

## Compliance Requirements

### GDPR Compliance

Data protection measures:
- Right to be forgotten implementation
- Data portability features
- Consent management
- Data minimization principles

### SOC 2 Type II

Control objectives:
- Security controls testing
- Availability monitoring
- Processing integrity validation
- Confidentiality protection
- Privacy safeguards
