# System Architecture Design

This document outlines the high-level architecture of our distributed system.

## Overview

Our system follows a microservices architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns. The architecture is designed for scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance.

Key principles:
- Microservices architecture
- Event-driven communication
- API-first design
- Cloud-native deployment

## Core Components

### API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests. It handles:
- Request routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation

```yaml
apiGateway:
  port: 8080
  timeout: 30s
  rateLimit: 1000/min
  auth:
    type: JWT
    secret: ${JWT_SECRET}
```

### User Service

Manages user accounts, profiles, and authentication:
- User registration and login
- Profile management
- Password reset functionality
- Social authentication integration

### Data Service

Handles all data operations:
- CRUD operations for business entities
- Data validation and transformation
- Caching layer integration
- Database connection pooling

## Database Schema

| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|-------|---------|------------|
| users | User accounts | id, email, password_hash |
| profiles | User profiles | user_id, name, avatar_url |
| sessions | Active sessions | id, user_id, expires_at |

## Deployment Architecture

The system is deployed using Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes:

```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
